/*
Promise Time Limit

Given an asynchronous function fn and a time t in milliseconds, return a new time limited version of the input function. fn takes arguments provided to the time limited function.

The time limited function should follow these rules:

If the fn completes within the time limit of t milliseconds, the time limited function should resolve with the result.
If the execution of the fn exceeds the time limit, the time limited function should reject with the string "Time Limit Exceeded".
 

Example 1:

Input: 
fn = async (n) => { 
  await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); 
  return n * n; 
}
inputs = [5]
t = 50
Output: {"rejected":"Time Limit Exceeded","time":50}
Explanation:
const limited = timeLimit(fn, t)
const start = performance.now()
let result;
try {
   const res = await limited(...inputs)
   result = {"resolved": res, "time": Math.floor(performance.now() - start)};
} catch (err) {
   result = {"rejected": err, "time": Math.floor(performance.now() - start)};
}
console.log(result) // Output

The provided function is set to resolve after 100ms. However, the time limit is set to 50ms. It rejects at t=50ms because the time limit was reached.
Example 2:

Input: 
fn = async (n) => { 
  await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 100)); 
  return n * n; 
}
inputs = [5]
t = 150
Output: {"resolved":25,"time":100}
Explanation:
The function resolved 5 * 5 = 25 at t=100ms. The time limit is never reached.
Example 3:

Input: 
fn = async (a, b) => { 
  await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, 120)); 
  return a + b; 
}
inputs = [5,10]
t = 150
Output: {"resolved":15,"time":120}
Explanation:
​​​​The function resolved 5 + 10 = 15 at t=120ms. The time limit is never reached.
Example 4:

Input: 
fn = async () => { 
  throw "Error";
}
inputs = []
t = 1000
Output: {"rejected":"Error","time":0}
Explanation:
The function immediately throws an error.
 

Constraints:

0 <= inputs.length <= 10
0 <= t <= 1000
fn returns a promise

function timeLimit(fn, t) {
  return async function(...args) {
    // Promise that will reject after t milliseconds
    const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => reject("Time Limit Exceeded"), t);
    });

    // Execute fn and race it against the timeout promise
    return Promise.race([fn(...args), timeoutPromise]);
  };
}

/*
The timeLimit function wraps an asynchronous function fn to enforce a time limit t (in milliseconds). 
It returns a new function that, when called, races between the execution of fn and a timeout promise that rejects with "Time Limit Exceeded" after t milliseconds. 
If fn completes within the time limit, its result is returned; otherwise, the timeout promise triggers, rejecting with the error message.
